Consumers today (2020) face virtually no barriers with the consumption of digital content, e.g. music, videos and e-books online. Cost is effectively zero and options are infinite. This "utopia" of content options has made it difficult for authors to realize a path toward meaningful revenue.

One reason for this is that digital content prices are not controlled by supply and demand. The price paid to authors is static and determined largely by the platforms that distribute the content. Unlike other industries where owners set their product price based on a number of business factors, “pay per click” rates are applied to digital content creating a clickbait driven ecosystem with diminishing ROI.

Much like decreasing price has no impact on the market, increasing quality does not materially impact the market either, as consumers have an unlimited number of algorithmically recommended "just as good or better" options.
